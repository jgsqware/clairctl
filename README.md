> Tracking container vulnerabilities with Clair Control

Clairctl is a lightweight command-line tool doing the bridge between Registries as Docker Hub, Docker Registry or Quay.io, and the CoreOS vulnerability tracker, Clair.
Clairctl will play as reverse proxy for authentication.

Clairctl version is align with the [CoreOS Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair) supported version.

# Installation

## Released version:

Go to [Release](https://github.com/jgsqware/clairctl/releases) and download your corresponding version

## Master branch version

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgsqware/clairctl/master/install.sh | sh
``` 

# Docker-compose

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jgsqware/clairctl.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/jgsqware/clairctl
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jgsqware/clairctl
$ docker-compose up -d postgres
Creating network "clairctl_default" with the default driver
Creating clairctl_postgres_1 ...
Creating clairctl_clair_1 ...
Creating clairctl_clairctl_1 ...
```

The above commands will check out the `clairctl` repo and start the complete postgres/clair/clairctl stack.

```bash
$ docker-compose exec clairctl clairctl health

Clair: âœ”
```

The above command will make sure clairctl can reach clair.

If you wish to serve local images to clair, the user inside the clairctl container will need read access to `/var/run/docker.sock`.

Give the user access by:
  - Running the container as root (`--user root` with `docker run` or `user: root` with `docker-compose`)
  - Add the container user to the docker group (`----group-add group_id` with `docker run` or `group_add: group_id` with `docker-compose`)

To get the group name or id, simply execute :

```bash
$ docker-compose exec clairctl ls -alh /var/run/docker.sock
srw-rw----    1 root     50             0 Jul 18 09:48 /var/run/docker.sock
```

In the example above, 50 is the required group.

# Amazon AWS ECR and clairctl

## Setup your environment for AWS ECR 

### via .aws/credentials

(Optional) If you choose to use your `~/.aws/credentials` file for configuration make the following changes.

Your `~/.aws/credentials` you wwill have to add a section for each ECR `registry id` that you use. 

For the below example the `registry id ` is `111111111111`

Copy the `~/.aws/credentials` for `[default]` settings to create settings for `[111111111111]`

E.G.:

```bash

[deafult]

aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID 
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

[111111111111]

aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID 
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
 
```

### Via Environmental variables 

#### Session_token and Access_key_id

``` 
    export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=<token_value>
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key_value>
```

#### (OR) Secret_access_Key

```
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_value>`
```

## Running Clairctl

### Docker-Compose

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` file that you can use to help start the 3 containers needed up.

#### AWS configuration

##### Set AWS_REGION from environmental variable 

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html>

replace `amazon-zone` with the zone for your ECR

`export AWS_REGION=amazon-zone # e.g.: us-east-1 or eu-west-2`

##### Set AWS_REGION in docker-compose.yml
  
Uncomment the following entry in the `clairctl:` `environment:` of and add the value of your ECR region. 

`#    - AWS_REGION= # put your region E.G.: us-east-1, eu-west-2 `

E.G:

`     - AWS_REGION=us-east-1 # put your region E.G.: us-east-1, eu-west-2 `

##### Pass AWS Secrets to docker container 

You will have to choose one of 3 options on passing the AWS secrets to the docker container.
 
Uncomment the one type you chose.

1. Use `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` from environmental variables.

1. Use `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` from an environmental variable

1. Use the mounting of the `.aws` directory from your home directory. 


#### Run Docker-compose  

Start the 3 container

` docker-compose up -d`

#### Run commands against the clairctl docker instance.

```
    docker-compose exec clairctl clairctl COMMAND AWS_ECR_URL/your-company-or-grouping/your-container:docker_version
```

E.G.:

```
    docker-compose exec clairctl clairctl pull 111111111111.dkr.ecr.amazon-zone.amazonaws.com/your-company-or-grouping/your-container:docker_version
```

### Command line 

#### Set AWS_REGION for go command line 

<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html>

replace `amazon-zone` with the zone for your ECR

`export AWS_REGION=amazon-zone # e.g.: us-east-1 or eu-west-2`

#### Setup your .aws/credentials

[Link to setup your environment for ECR](#setup-your-environment-for-aws-ecr)

#### Run the clarictl command

```
    ./clairctl pull 111111111111.dkr.ecr.amazon-zone.amazonaws.com/your-company-or-grouping/your-container:docker_version
```


# Building the latest binaries

**clairctl** requires Go 1.8+.

Install Glide:
```
curl https://glide.sh/get | sh
```

Clone and build:
```
git clone git@github.com:jgsqware/clairctl.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/jgsqware/clairctl
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/jgsqware/clairctl
glide install -v
go get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...
go generate ./clair
go build
```

This will result in a `clairctl` executable in the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/jgsqware/clairctl` folder.

# Build the Docker Container from Source Locally

If you are making modifications to the source code and want to test it locally there is another docker file `LocalDockerfile`

The project `Dockerfile` downloads a zip file of the source from the project from github.
 
`https://github.com/jgsqware/clairctl/archive/master.zip`

You will never see your local changes persisted into the container if you use `docker build .`

There is a script to help building from the source.  

`./local-docker.sh OPTIONAL_TAG_NAME`

E.G.:

Build a tagged version

`./local-docker.sh jgsqware/clairctl:1.2.9`

or 

Build an untagged version for local development.

`./local-docker.sh`

Make sure to change the tag for clairctl in your local docker-compose.yml if you have built a different tagged version.

# FAQ

## I get 400 errors !

If you get 400 errors, check out clair's logs. The usual reasons are :
  
  - You are serving a local image, and clair cannot connect to clairctl.
  - You are trying to analyze an official image from docker hub and you have not done a docker login first.
  
Please try these two things before opening an Issue.

## I get access denied on /var/run/docker.sock

If you are running the stack with the provided `docker-compose.yml`, don't forget to grant the user from the clairctl container access to `/var/run/docker.sock`. 

All steps are detailed in the Docker-compose section above.
